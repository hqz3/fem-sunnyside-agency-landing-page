## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention
- Accessibility

### Notes

For this project, my priorities were to design the website mobile-first while using BEM naming convention to write clearer, more maintainable CSS code that avoids namespace collisions and specificity issues. I tried designing the website as close as possible to the design mockup, for that purpose, PixelParallel was an invaluable design tool.

This site made use of multiple images, which led to deeper research on using `background-image`, `background-size`, and `background-position`.

Finally, I incorporated accessibility best practices for screen reader users.
